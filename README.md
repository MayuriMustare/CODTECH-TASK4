# Overview of the Project:
# Project: Machine Learning Model Implementation
# A] Objective:
To develop a predictive machine learning model using Scikit-learn that classifies or predicts outcomes based on a given dataset (e.g., spam email detection).
# B] Key Activities:
1. Dataset Preparation: Load and preprocess the dataset, Handle missing values and perform feature scaling if needed, Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. Model Selection and Training: Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm for classification or regression (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.), Train the model using the training dataset.
3. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or AUC-ROC for classification tasks.
4. Implementation and Deployment: Implement the entire process in a Jupyter Notebook, Showcase results through plots, tables, and explanations.
# C] Technologies Used:
1. Programming Language: Python
2. Libraries: Scikit-learn: For model development and evaluation, Pandas: For data manipulation, NumPy: For numerical operations, Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: For implementation and presentation.
